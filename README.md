<b>RecipeFinder Description</b>

  &nbsp;RecipeFinder is a tool meant to help find inspiration in the kitchen by providing a diverse collection of recipes. 
  &nbsp;The application will provide a list with all the available recipes and also recipe pages. 
  &nbsp;The user can create an account, which will serve as a requirement to add recipes and to keep track of the user’s favorite recipes.

  &nbsp;Eventually, the user will have the option to filter the recipes’ required ingredients based on the available products in its fridge, but that represents a low priority. 
  &nbsp;Therefore this feature will exist in a future version if it won’t be possible to do it in the current one.
