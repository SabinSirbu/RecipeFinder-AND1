RecipeFinder Description

  RecipeFinder is a tool meant to help find inspiration in the kitchen by providing a diverse collection of recipes. 
  The application will provide a list with all the available recipes and also recipe pages. 
  The user can create an account, which will serve as a requirement to add recipes and to keep track of the user’s favorite recipes.

  Eventually, the user will have the option to filter the recipes’ required ingredients based on the available products in its fridge, but that represents a low priority. 
  Therefore this feature will exist in a future version if it won’t be possible to do it in the current one.
